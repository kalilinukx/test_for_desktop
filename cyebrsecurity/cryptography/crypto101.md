This room will cover:
Why cryptography matters for security and CTFs
The two main classes of cryptography and their uses
RSA, and some of the uses of RSA
2 methods of Key Exchange
Notes about the future of encryption with the rise of Quantum Computing
Note: This room expects some familiarity with tools, and some research into how to use them yourself!
I recommend completing CC Pentesting first for some familiarity with John The Ripper.
Many of these key terms are shared with https://tryhackme.com/room/hashingcrypto101, so you might be able to skip over some if you're already familiar.

Ciphertext - The result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data

Cipher - A method of encrypting or decrypting data. Modern ciphers are cryptographic, but there are many non cryptographic ciphers like Caesar.

Plaintext - Data before encryption, often text but not always. Could be a photograph or other file

Encryption - Transforming data into ciphertext, using a cipher.

Encoding - NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.

Key - Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.

Passphrase - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.

Asymmetric encryption - Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.

Symmetric encryption - Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt

Brute force - Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key

Cryptanalysis - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths

Alice and Bob - Used to represent 2 people who generally want to communicate. Theyâ€™re named Alice and Bob because this gives them the initials A and B. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob for more information, as these extend through the alphabet to represent many different people involved in communication.

WARNING: This room is very theory heavy. Cryptography is a big topic, and this room is designed to just scratch the surface.

I agree not to complain too much about how theory heavy this room is.

No answer needed
Are SSH keys protected with a passphrase or a password?

passphrase
