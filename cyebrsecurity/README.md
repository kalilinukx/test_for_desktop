 # CYBERSECURITY
 KEY CONCEPETS OF CYBERSECURITY 
 a -> confendentiality
 b -> integrity
 c -> avalability

 confidentiality - IN this this the providers of CYBERSECURITY needs to maintain the data to be highly encrypted to make to secure in case of any vulnerabilities are exploited out by the attacker they to need to secure it from them by using latest encryption algorithms 

 Integrity - IN this the data data donesnt need to be tampered with by the attacker no authorized modification in done .
 Avaiability - IN this the data needs to befirst validated by the providers due to brute force attack by attackers the server is needs to be maintained by the provider whick is very hard in this case because the server will be very busy responding to requests that are wrongly sent by brute force attacks by attackers.
