In these set of tasks you'll learn the following:

brute forcing 
hash cracking 
service enumeration
Linux Enumeration
The main goal here is to learn as much as possible. Make sure you are connected to our network using your OpenVPN configuration file.

help guides -?
use an nmap scan to look for the open ports

use dirsearch/dirbuster to find the hidden directories.
what about using SMB to find a username?

What about using a tool like hydra to bruteforce?

use a privilege escalation checklist or tool like LinEnum

Ã—
apart from a password, how else can a user access a machine

use john the ripper to bruteforce the passphrase
