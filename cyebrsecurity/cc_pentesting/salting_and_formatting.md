No matter what tool you use, virtually all of them have the exact same format. A file with the hash(s) in it with each hash being separated by a newline.

Example:

<hash 1>

<hash 2>

<hash 3>



Salts are typically appended onto the hash with a colon and the salt. Files with salted hashes still follow the same convention with each hash being separated by a newline.

Example:

<hash1>:<salt>

<hash2>:<salt>

<hash3>:<salt>



Note: Different hashing algorithms treat salts differently. Some prepend them and some append them. Research what it is you're trying to crack, and make the distinction.
