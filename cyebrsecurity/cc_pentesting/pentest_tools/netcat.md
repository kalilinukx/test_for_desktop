Netcat aka nc is an extremely versatile tool. It allows users to connect to specific ports and send and receive data. It also allows machines to receive data and connections on specific ports, which makes nc a very popular tool to gain a Reverse Shell.



After you connect to a port with nc you will be able to send data, this also has the consequence of the user being able to pipe data through nc. For example one can doecho hello | nc <ip> 1234 to send the string hello to the service running on port 1234



Note: There are multiple versions of nc, so if you are unable to find an answer in your specific man page, try reading the man page for others!
