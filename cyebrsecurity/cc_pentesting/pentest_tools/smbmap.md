Continuing with the trend of tools having "map" in the name being extremely popular, smbmap is one of the best ways to enumerate samba. smbmap allows pen-testers to run commands(given proper permissions), download and upload files, and overall is just incredibly useful for smb enumeration.

How do you set the username to authenticate with?

-u
What about the password?    

-p
How do you set the host?

-H
What flag runs a command on the server(assuming you have permissions that is)?

-x 
How do you specify the share to enumerate?

-s
How do you set which domain to enumerate?

-d
What flag downloads a file?
--download
What about uploading one?

--upload
Given the username "admin", the password "password", and the ip "10.10.10.10", how would you run ipconfig on that machine

smbmap -u "admin" -p "password" -H 10.10.10.10 -x "ipconfig"
