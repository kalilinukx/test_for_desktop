Task 1  Introduction
The idea behind this room is to provide an introduction to various tools and concepts commonly encountered in penetration testing. 

This room assumes that you have basic linux and networking knowledge. This room is also not meant to be a "be all end all" for penetration testing

The tasks in this room can be completed in any order; however, if you are new to penetration testing, completing the first two sections is recommended before doing anything else.
