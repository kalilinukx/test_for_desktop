The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a standardised model which we use to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking. In practice, it's actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off; however the OSI model, in many ways, is easier to get an initial understanding from.

The OSI model consists of seven layers:

OSI 
1 -> APPLICATION
2 -> PRESENTATION
3 -> SESSION
4 -> TRANSPORT
5 -> NETWORK
6 -> DATA LINK
7 -> PHYSICAL
