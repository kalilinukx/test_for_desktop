Now that you've logged into the server, you're gonna wanna do things, and everything that can be done over SSH is done by running commands. To start out, we'll take a look at some of the basic commands, and the first command will be echo. Type echo hello, and press enter and you'll see your input echoed back at you.





Much like the word it's named after, echoreturns whatever is inputted into it. Congratulations, you've just ran your first Linux command!
