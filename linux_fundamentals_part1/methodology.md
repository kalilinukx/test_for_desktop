After careful consideration, I've deemed the best way to go about this is to introduce various concepts in sections, with each section being more complex and requiring knowledge from the previous section. To better enable the transition between section, I've split each section into different users in the VM; when you finish a section you'll have to complete a challenge and then you'll be able to move onto the next section.

Read the above.
