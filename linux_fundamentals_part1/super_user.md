Now that we have our next user password, it seems like a good time to cover su. su is a command that allows you to change the user, without logging out and logging back in again. For example if you wanted to switch to shiba2 while you're the user shiba1, you would type su shiba2 . You would then be prompted for a password and if you entered shiba2's password you would then become shiba2



Note: Typing su on its own is equivalent to typing su root. 

How do you specify which shell is used when you login?    

-s
