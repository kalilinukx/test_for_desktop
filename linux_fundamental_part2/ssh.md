SSH is the act of remotely accessing a machine. SSH allows you to run commands interactively on the remote machine. This is done through the use of a program on the target machine, which allows the ssh client to interface with the target host.

While the most common usage of a regular operating system is graphical(allowing you to see pictures, web browsers, file managers etc.) SSH works through a command line, meaning anything done on the target machine will be done through a command prompt similar to this.



It may look intimidating at first, but you'll soon find out you can do much of the same functionality that you're able to do using graphical user interfaces!

 It is an invaluable tool, and how you will be accessing this machine to learn and to do the challenges. Depending on the operating system there are different ways of SSHing into a machine. This section will purely focus on the windows way(PuTTY), and after we learn more about linux commands, and how they work, we'll return back to this section and learn about the linux method.
