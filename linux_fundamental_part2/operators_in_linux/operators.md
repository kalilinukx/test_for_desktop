&& means as you might expect "and". Meaning && allows you to execute a second command after the first one has executed successfully. Meaning ls && echo hello will work fine, but dljahfrsdkjlhfsdhjklfsdhkljfh && echo hello will fail.



Note: Since the second command happens after the first command, you can use something created in the first command in the second command.
