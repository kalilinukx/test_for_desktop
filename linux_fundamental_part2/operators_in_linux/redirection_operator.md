> is the operator for output redirection. Meaning that you can redirect the output of any command to a file. For example if I were to run echo hello > file, then instead of outputting hello to the console, it would save that output to a file called file.



It is worth noting that if you were to use this operator on a file that already exists, it would completely erase the contents of that file and replace it with the output from your command



How would you output twenty to a file called test
